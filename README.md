# Custom-Elasticsearch-index
A bash script to put custom variables into elasticsearch
The {  } section is where you can put variable to send into elasticsearch. The “/bgp/status/” appended to the elasticsearch:9200 url will actually create a custom index (needs to be added through the kibana GUI).  The timestamp variable has been converted to be accepted by elasticsearch.
